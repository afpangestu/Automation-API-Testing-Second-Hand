## Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools and frameworks to automate test execution, compare actual outcomes to expected outcomes, and generate test reports. This helps to increase efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of testing processes, as well as reducing the time and costs associated with manual testing. <br><br>In here we are going to test Second Hand API (https://secondhand.binaracademy.org/api-docs/index.html). We are going to use tools and test frameworks like TestNG with REST Asured for the automation. This project focuses on automating tests for the Second Hand APi using REST Assured Java.

## Scope

The project covers the following areas of the Second Hand Endpoints:

- Authentication, including methods POST for register and sign in users.
- Categories, including methods GET of list categories.
- Offers, including methods POST GET UPDATE of offers.
- Products, including methods POST GET DELETE of product.
- Profile, including methods GET and UPDATE of profile.

## Features

- Uses REST Assured for testing and validating REST APIs.
- Organizes test scenarios using TestNG testing framework.
- Includes a wide range of test cases covering auth, products, offers, and more.
- Provides easy-to-understand bug reports and test outcomes.


## Tools and Technologies Used

This test automation project for Swag Labs utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to streamline the testing process and ensure efficient and accurate results.

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for writing the test automation code.

- **REST Assured**: An open-source framework for testing and validating REST APIs in Java, which allows you to write comprehensive tests with minimal code.

- **TestNG**: A popular and most widely used testing framework for Selenium automation.

- **Maven**: A build and dependency management tool that simplifies project setup and maintenance.

- **IntelliJ IDE**:  An integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages.

- **Jira**:  An agile project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and manage work.

These technologies are combined to create an effective testing framework that automates test cases, performs comparisons between expected and actual outcomes, and generates detailed test reports.


## Test Cases

The test cases are written in third-party platform using [Qase](https://qase.io/). Each test case covers various aspects of the Swag Labs website, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Installation

Ensure that you have the following tools and technologies installed on your machine:

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

  <br><br>Note: Make sure to download the relavent tools version for your machine, and put it into project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the project in IntelliJ or your preferred IDE.
2. Navigate to the `src/test/java/testng` directory.
3. Locate the test files `testng.xml`.
4. Run the test by `Right click > Run` to execute the automated test scenarios.
